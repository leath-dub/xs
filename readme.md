# XS
x screenshot

## About
xs is a simple xcb based screenshot tool. It is partly a port of
[xscreenshot](https://git.codemadness.org/xscreenshot) to xcb with some
extra features.

## Features
* draw screenshot you wish to take ( if no arguments are given )
* specify a index range of monitors you wish to screenshot

## Notes
This is in very early development. You can try [my old screenshot
tool](https://github.com/leath-dub/sscreenshot) if you have issues with this
one. I am working on this as that tool had poor support for multi monitors and
is also buggy.
